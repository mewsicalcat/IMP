v1.1.22 
Speed improvements from Harris Jaffee to countGC, spatialAdjustAtom, spatialAdjust, spatialAdjustVec, as.image

v1.1.21
replaced oligo::basecontent with Biostrings::alphabetFrequency in countGC

v1.1.19
readCharm now reports a warning if not all file names contain either the ut or md arguments.

v1.1.18
Changed the ignoreChr argument of dmrFinder to removeIf, which is more general.

v1.1.17
Changed the previously added warning to a message.  Also added a column to the DMR tables output by dmrFinder reporting the number of probes in each DMR.

v1.1.16
Added a warning message to readCharm if any columns of sampleKey contain discrepant values and are therefore removed.

v1.1.15
Moved a line of code that checks the arguments provided in dmrFinder to prevent an error message later on.

v1.1.14
Added an additional check to the start of methp to make sure excludeIndex is a numeric or integer vector.  Also added ignoreChr argument to dmrFinder to enable removing all DMRs in specified chromosomes from the resulting DMR tables.

v1.1.13
Added an additional check to the start of dmrFinder to prevent a cryptic error later.  Also changed the manual page for methp to correct the description of the excludeIndex argument.

v1.1.12

v1.1.11
Added 'plot.p' argument to dmrPlot and regionPlot.  If plot.p=FALSE, the functions will return plots using the dmr$l data rather than the dmr$p data.  If dmrFinder was used on l instead of p, though, plot.p is necessarily FALSE.

v1.1.10
Changed the txtProgressBar progress reports in get.tt, get.tt.paired, and get.smooth from style=3 to style=1.

v1.1.9
Added documentation for dmrPlot and regionPlot.  Updated documentation for dmrFinder and dmrFdr.  Made RColorBrewer and genefilter packages dependencies.

Added optional argument to dmrPlot to specify how much to plot on either side of each DMR.

Bugfix in methPercent. Percentage methylation estimates will change slightly. This fix has been backported to v1.0.1.
Fixed formatting of the NEWS file.

v1.1.4
Added dmrPlot to exports

V1.1.3
Added functions to plot results of dmrFinder.
Also added options to dmrFinder that enable doing comparisons on paired samples.

 Added spatial effect correction

2009-02-25 v0.5
The following procedure is used to estimate the proportion of methylated DNA:
Background removal: 
  We fit an RMA-like model to each array where the background signal 
  is Normal(mu, s2) and the true signal is Exp(alpha). mu is estimated 
  by fitting a loess curve through the mode of the background probe
  distribution for each GC-content bin. s2 is calculated as usual
  but only using background probes. alpha are estimated 
  as usual using the signal probes
Differential amplification correction:
  We account for differential amplification by estimating a correction
  factor with a loess curve fit through the control probes (p=1).
Estimation of p
  We use the model S = tot-en = X+Y. 
  X = -log(1-p) ~ Exp(alpha) and Y ~ N(0, s2) 
  This is the similar to the RMA model except the normal is not 
  truncated and has mean 0. The posterior expectation of X|S is the same 
  as in the RMA model except for two factors that are ignored by RMA anyway.
  After calculating the posterior expectation of -log(1-p) we simply
  solve for p.

 
TO DO
 Need to add fix for a CHARM array annotation problem:
     Index=which(pns=="chr1:226808280-226853529")
